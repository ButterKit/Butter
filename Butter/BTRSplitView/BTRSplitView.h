 @param splitview A weak reference to the splitview that owns the block.
 @param ctx The drawing context for the divider.
 @param rect The rectangle specifying the region that needs redrawing within the divider.
 @param index The index of the divider being redrawn.
 @discussion Because we cannot override -dividerColor for index-based drawing, BTRSplitView
 provides this block so drawing of dividers can be done in an index-based fashion.  Dividers
 work much like subviews, in that they have zero-based indexes, however they are drawn, rather than
 added as subviews.

 @param withAnimation Specify this to have the divider animate for the default duration (0.25 sec.), else default to NSSplitView's interpretation
 @discussion Whether animation is applied or not, the frames of the views themselves are adjusted,
 meaning that we get consistent redraw behavior, and smooth collapsing because BTRSplitView defaults to having
 a Core Animation layer.  Resize is subject to the constraints outlined in your delegate, so animation reserves the
 right to adjust the frames of adjacent subviews to ensure the position request is satisfied.
